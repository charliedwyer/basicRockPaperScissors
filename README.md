# basicRockPaperScissors
Hi!

This project is the childhood classic Rock Paper Scissors!

I made this project to practice my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This is my first project using DOM manipulation. Overall the project was fairly simple for a beginner. The main things I wanted to improve on during this project was using events and event listeners in JavaScript. Additionally, work on my CSS organization as it can get messy in my styles page.

The first iteration was a simple console game.

The second iteration added a ui for the game.

Thanks!
